  The `"profiles"` section you're seeing is from the `launchSettings.json` file in an ASP.NET Core project. 
  It defines how your app is launched during development in different **environments or hosting modes**.
  Here's a breakdown of the **differences between the profiles** listed:

    /*
    ### 🔹 1. `"http"` Profile

    ```json
    "profile": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5256",
    }
    ```

    * **Type**: Runs the app using the built-in Kestrel web server with **HTTP only**.
    * **Use Case**: Useful for quick testing on local HTTP.
    * **Key Point**: Doesn't use HTTPS, so **not secure** for anything sensitive.

    /*
          ### 🔹 2. `"https"` Profile

      ```json
      "profile": {
        "commandName": "Project",
        "applicationUrl": "https://localhost:7200;http://localhost:5256",
      }
      ```

      * **Type**: Runs the app using Kestrel with both **HTTP and HTTPS**.
      * **Use Case**: Standard for development, as it mimics production more closely (which usually uses HTTPS).
      * **Key Point**: Preferred for local development with security features.

    ### 🔹 3. `"IIS Express"` Profile

    ```json
    "profile": {
      "commandName": "IISExpress",
    }
    ```

    * **Type**: Runs the app using **IIS Express**, the lightweight dev web server built into Visual Studio.
    * **Use Case**: Useful for testing apps in an environment closer to **full IIS**, often needed for **Windows Authentication**.
    * **Key Point**: Allows using Windows Authentication out of the box.

  ### ✅ Summary Table

| Profile Name  | Web Server  | HTTPS Support | Auth Compatibility                  | Launch Style        |
| ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `http`        | Kestrel     | ❌             | Limited (no secure features)        | HTTP only           |
| `https`       | Kestrel     | ✅             | Good for dev with Identity, cookies | HTTP + HTTPS        |
| `IIS Express` | IIS Express | ✅             | Supports Windows Auth well          | Like production IIS |

---

### 🔐 Authentication Impact

* **Windows Authentication**: Only supported natively in **IIS Express** or full IIS.
* **Microsoft Identity (Azure AD)** and **Individual Accounts**: 
  Work fine in any profile with HTTPS enabled (`https` or `IIS Express`), but HTTPS is preferred for secure tokens and cookies.
